# Assignment-1
I chose to express a range of emotions on canvas. 
The range of emotions I want to express is from anger to calming down, to calm. 

Inspired by how emotions impact and change your breathing patterns.  I wanted to illustrate a breathing pattern of someone who is angry, calming down from being angry, and calm; Through the use of Colour, Framerate, and Mousepressed.

  Colour:
-Warm colours for Angry: When angry, blood and body gets hot.
-Warm and Cool colours for Calming Down.
-Cool colours for Calm: When calm, blood and body normal temp and cooler than when angry. 
  
  Framerate:
-Angry: Framerate is a higher number, so the contracting of ellipse is fast. Represent fast heart racing heart caused by anger 
-Calm: Framerate is a lower number, so the contracting ellipse is slow.Represent normal heart rate when calm and resting

  Mousepressed:
-When angry it is easy to remain angry and get consumed by it which is why user has to pressed the mouse in order to start the calming down process. 
-As user continue to press the mouse it represent the effort they made in their mind or body to let go of their anger. 
-As user continue clicking gradually the ellipses start the slow down and screen become calm.
